This is developed in .NET MVC Framework with C# as backend language.

    1) Adding realtime updates to our likes counter with Pusher.
            While a user clicks a like button weâ€™d like them to know when more people like the button by increasing the number of likes without requiring a refresh. 
            We can achieve this by using Pusher.
            Install Pusher via NuGet - *a packer manager for ASP.NET * <br>
    2)We can use Blazor in .NET for client side rendering to increment the counter and save it in a table/database.
